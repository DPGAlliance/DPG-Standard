For Open Content we require the use of a [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/). While we encourage projects to use a license which allows for both derivatives and commercial reuse or dedicate content to the public domain ([CC0](https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/)) we also accept the following licenses which do not allow for commercial reuse: [CC-BY-NC](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) and [CC-BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

**3. Documentation of ownership** |	Ownership of everything that the project produces must be clearly defined and documented i.e. through copyright, trademark or other publicly available information.
**4. Mandatory dependencies** |	If the open source project has mandatory dependencies that create more restrictions than the original license the projects must be able to demonstrate independence from the closed component and/or indicate the existence of functional, open alternatives.
**5. Documentation** |	The project must have some documentation of the source code, use cases, and/or functional requirements. For content, this should indicate any relevant compatible apps, software, hardware required to access the content and instructions about how to use it. For software projects, this should be present as technical documentation that would allow a technical person unfamiliar with the project to  launch and run the software. For data projects, this should be present as documentation that describes all the fields in the set, and provides context on how the data was collected and how it should be interpreted.
**6. Mechanism for extracting data** |	If this project has non personally identifiable information there must be a mechanism for extracting or importing non personally identifiable information (PII) data from the system in a non-proprietary format.
**7. Adherence to privacy and applicable laws** |	The project must state that it complies with relevant privacy laws, and all applicable international and domestic laws. Projects that collect data must identify the types of data collected and stored and demonstrate that the project ensures the privacy and security of this data and has taken steps to prevent adverse impacts resulting from its collection, storage and distribution.
**8. Adherence to standards & best practices** |	Projects must demonstrate adherence to standards, best practices and/or principles. i.e. the principles for digital development.

**10. Inappropriate & illegal content** |	Projects that collect, store or distribute content must have policies identifying inappropriate and illegal content such as child sexual abuse materials and mechanisms for detecting and moderating inappropriate/illegal content.
**11.
