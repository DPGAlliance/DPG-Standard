<h1 align="center">Digital Public Goods Standard</h1>

The [Digital Public Goods Standard](standard.md) is a set of specifications and guidelines designed to maximize consensus about whether a project conforms to the definition of digital public goods set by the UN Secretary-General in the [2020 Roadmap for Digital Cooperation](https://www.un.org/en/content/digital-cooperation-roadmap/): *digital public goods must be open source software, open data, open AI models, open standards, and open content that adhere to privacy and other applicable laws and best practices, do no harm, and help attain the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).*

The DPG Standard establishes a baseline that must be met in order to earn recognition as a digital public good by the [Digital Public Goods Alliance](https://digitalpublicgoods.net) (DPGA) and the broader community. The DPG Standard is an open project and therefore [open to contribution](standard.md). The DPGA supports the [5 Core Principles of OpenStand](openstand.md) in the development of the DPG Standard.

## 🔎 Current Version

[The DPG Standard](standard.md) is currently at version 1.1.6, published on Sep. 4, 2024; view the [changelog](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## ✅ Application of the DPG Standard

We encourage creators, maintainers, funders, implementers, and consumers to use this standard to recognize, assess, and support digital public goods. The standard is operationalized through a [questionary](https://app.digitalpublicgoods.net/form) that is required as part of the assessment process. We maintain a list of digital public goods that meet the DPG Standard described above on [our registry](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry). Projects are reviewed annually and archived if they do not continue to meet the Standard, as per our [review policy](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/dpg-resources/blob/main/docs/dpg-review-policy.md).

![DPG Application Review Policy](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/dpg-resources/blob/main/docs/assets/dpg-review-flow.png)

We apply the DPG Standard to projects that have been [nominated directly](https://app.digitalpublicgoods.net/form). Solutions submitted to our platform will undergo two stages of review to ensure they meet the requirements set in the DPG Standard. As a project undergoes various reviews it will move from **nominee** to a fully reviewed **digital public good**. If a project meets the DPG Standard it will be officially considered a digital public good and will appear as such in the DPG Registry, and may be eligible for additional recognition and support.

## 🤗 Code of Conduct
