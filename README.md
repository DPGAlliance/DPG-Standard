<h1 align="center">Digital Public Goods Standard</h1>

The [digital public goods standard](standard.md) is a set of specifications and guidelines designed to maximize consensus about whether something conforms to the definition of digital public goods as laid out by the UN Secretary General in the 2020 Roadmap to Digital Cooperation: *digital public goods must be open source software, open data, open AI models, open standards and open content that adhere to privacy and other applicable laws and best practices, do no harm, and help attain the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).*

This standard establishes a baseline of quality that must be met in order to earn recognition as a digital public good by the [Digital Public Goods Alliance](https://digitalpublicgoods.net) and broader community. The standard itself is [open to contribution](standard.md) and we invite anyone who uses and benefits from the standard to [join our growing list of endorsers](endorsement.md). 

## 🔎 Current Version

[The Standard](standard.md) is currently at version 1.0, published on Sept. 15, 2020.

## ✅ Application of the Standard

We encourage creators, maintainers, funders, implementers and consumers to use this standard to recognize, assess and support digital public goods. The standard is operationalized through a [questionary](standard-questions.md) that is required as part of the assessment process. We maintain a list of vetted digital public goods that meet the standard described above on [our platform](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/platform). 

![Vetting Process](docs/process.svg)

We apply this standard to projects on our platform that have either been [nominated directly](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGzlBiecPBlVvJXmcMKXF3zdxASY8vGnrdnNNwp7fVKb169A/viewform) or have been pulled together from partnership databases. Projects that are submitted to our platform will undergo three stages of review to ensure that they meet the requirements laid out in the standard. As a project undergoes various reviews it will move from **Nominee**, to **Candidate**, to a fully reviewed **Digital Public Good**. 

Movement through the process shall be transparently displayed on GitHub and can be [viewed here](https://github.com/unicef/publicgoods-candidates/pulls). If a project meets the standard it will be officially considered a Digital Public Good and will be showcased on the website and may be eligible for additional recognition and support.

## 👍 Endorsements

The Standard is endorsed by [a growing list](endorsement.md) of open source, open content and open data advocacy and advancement experts. Endorsement means agreement with the standard for Digital Public Goods set out through the indicators, and a willingness to have your name and title publicly listed as having contributed to and endorsing the standard.
