# Digital Public Goods Standard Governance

This is work in progress. 

The purpose of this document is to present how the Digital Public Goods Alliance envisions engaging a growing community of
contributors and stakeholders around the Digital Public Goods Standard. Our ambition is to balance responsiveness to feedback, 
with stability and predictabilty for the standard so that it can be a framework that people can build for and to.

## Principles

The Digital Public Goods community adheres to the following principles:

* **Open**: The Digital Public Goods Standard is open content, refer to the [license terms](README#memo-license).  
* **Welcoming and Respectful**: See the [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct) below.
* **Transparent and Accessible**: Work and collaboration on the Standard should be done in public, hence the creation and management of this repository. See [Revisions](#revisions) below.

## Code of Conduct

We have adopted the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct v2](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and we expect all members of the
community to embrace it. Here's an excerpt on our pledge:

*We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.*

*We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.*

## Revisions

This section documents the processes for:
* proposing modifications to the current version of the standard 
* reviewing proposed changes 
* and incorporating them in forthcoming revisions

The latest version of the [Digital Public Goods Standard](standard.md) is found at the root folder of this repository. 
The standard is operationalized through a [questionary](standard-questions.md). This set of questions is used to screen 
projects or products, and validate whether they conform to the standard, and can thus be classified as Digital Public Goods.

### Priority

Our priority for Q4 2020 is to arrive at a stable version of the standard. Thus, we ask all comments and edits to be centered around the standard 
rather than the associated set of questions. The rationale is that if the standard were to change in a significant way over the
initial months, so would the questionary; and any preliminary work on the questions may need to be discarded.

### Proposing Changes

These are the suggested steps for proposing changes to the standard:
- First, review the existing [Pull Requests](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard/pulls) and check if your proposed change
has not already been proposed to avoid duplication. If it has already been proposed, you are encouraged to add your perspective
to the existing proposed change and argue for or against it, making constructive and compelling arguments.
- If none of the open pull requests address the issue you are proposing, 
[edit the standard](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard/edit/master/standard.md) and open a new Pull Request with your edits, guided by the "**one issue, one pull request**" guideline.
When opening a new pull request, be very explicit about the changes that you are proposing, and making the case for these changes. Otherwise, if your
contribution is a commentary or a general opinion, we will review it, but will not deem it actionable and close it.
- Once your pull request has been submitted, follow the discussion that will ensue.

### Classification of modifications

In order to streamline the review of proposals, we will use the following classification, labeling them accordingly:

* [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-minor_fix-c5def5)](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22minor+fix%22) These 
include mostly stylistic edits including, but not limited to: correcting typographical errors, making gramatical edits and adding or removing clarifying
statements with the aim of improving readibility of the standard or facilitating its understanding to the reader. These proposed changes do not alter the 
intended meaning of the existing indicators, nor introduce or remove key concepts.

* [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-major_change-FFA500)](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard/labels/major%20change) These include modifications 
that alter the existing indicators in significant ways, have implications across the board, but they do not challenge the purpose or scope of the standard.
These may also include reorganization of the various sections of the standard, removing existing sections altogether, or adding new indicators to the standard.

* [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-fundamental-b60205)](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard/labels/fundamental) These involve
fundamental or philosophical changes that challenge the purpose, the scope or the very existence of the standard.

## Proposal review

The process for reviewing and accepting proposals varies depending on the classification of the proposal:

* [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-minor_fix-c5def5)](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22minor+fix%22) After
leaving a minimum of one week to accept additional commentary from other members of the community, the pull request requires 1 Secretariat co-lead and 1 technical
lead (see [Current Roles](#current-roles)) to review and approve the issue in order to accept and merge it. This review will happen on a rolling basis, and there 
will be a monthly meeting to catch and address any outstanding such issues.

* [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-major_change-FFA500)](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard/labels/major%20change). The moderator will first assign it
to a member of the Alliance for further investigation over a period of up to two weeks. That person will report back and comment on the issue documenting and exploring
the implications of accepting or rejecting that change, and will open another period of up to two weeks for additional input from the community. We will inform
the members of the Alliance's Internal Strategy Group (ISG) giving them an equal chance to comment. Review for these changes will happen quarterly, and consensus from the 2 co-leads and 2 technical leads 
(see [Current Roles](#current-roles)) will be required to take action (either accept or reject).

* [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-fundamental-b60205)](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard/labels/fundamental). After validating the legitimacy of the 
proposal, we will open a consultation process with the major communities and stakeholders in the ecosystem, including the all of the [endorsers](endorsement.md).
The findings from this consultation process will be presented to the Alliance's Internal Strategy Group (ISG), who will have a week to veto or ask for more time
(where silence is implied consent). Consensus from the 2 co-leads and 2 technical leads (see [Current Roles](#current-roles)) will be required to take action 
(either accept or reject). Review for these changes will happen twice per year during the first year, and yearly thereafter.

## Versioning

All notable changes to this project will be documented in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) 
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) using a variation of the `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format (accounting for the fact that this applies to content, not code):

* *MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes*: [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-fundamental-b60205)](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard/labels/fundamental)
* *MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner*: [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-major_change-FFA500)](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard/labels/major%20change)
* *PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes*: [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-minor_fix-c5def5)](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22minor+fix%22)

### Release a new version

Follow these steps to release a new version:

1. Document your upcoming changes in `CHANGELOG.md`. Follow the existing structure and be consistent with the order of subsections: `Added`, `Changed`, `Deleted`. Also be sure to link the version in the diff list at the very bottom of the CHANGELOG.
2. Commit all the changes that will be included in the new version.
3. Tag the last commit, for example, for version 1.0.1:
    ```bash
    git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Version 1.0.1"
    ```
4. Push the tag to the origin:
    ```bash
    git push origin --tags
    ```
5. Visit https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard/releases and click on `Draft a New Release`:
    - Select the version you just tagged in step 3 above
    - Enter the `Release title`, for example `v1.0.1` consistent with the preceeding steps.
    - In the `Describe this release`, copy and paste the text from the CHANGELOG for this version in *raw form* (it's markdown after all). Preview and verify that it looks good (you can edit this information again later, no big deal if something is wrong in the description).
